/*
  Stacks
  -take from the top
  -place on the top
  -supposed to restrict you to make things easier on the long run.
  -Last in first out (LIFO)
  
  Implement this
  _____________________________________________________________________________
  myStack<Integer> s = new myStack<Integer>();
  s.push(10); //pushes the 10 onto the top of the stack s
  i=s.pop(); //remove the item from the top of the stack s and return it
  s.empty(); //returns true or false
  s.peek(); //returns but doesn't remove the top element of the stack
  _____________________________________________________________________________
  -push and pop are always needed for a stack class.
  -usually have empty/isEmpty and can have peek
  -sometimes have "cheat" methods like size and peeking at lower level elements
